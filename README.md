# TODO List

- [x] Add React project and integrate it with TypeScript.
- [x] Introduce WebPack and connect it with React and TypeScript.
- [x] Introduce Tailwind.
- [x] Configure GitHub Actions to use GitHub Pages. So the built web site will be deployed on GitHub Pages.
- [ ] Mimic the index page of https://tekstika.ee/, demo version. For demo, it does not communicate with the server so the frontend can complete it. (try not to see my original codes as much as possible).
